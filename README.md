# ES6-Tryout

This is a demo application to tryout some of the new ES6-features and to brainstorm some ideas how a framework-less,
simple module-system for basic web-pages could look like. Webpack is used for packaging and babel as ES6-to-ES5-transpiler.
Do not use this for production. This is just a playground.

### Installation

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Run webpack dev-server:

`webpack-dev-server --content-base src/ --hot`
